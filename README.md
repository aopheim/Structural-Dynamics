# Structural Dynamics
This repository contains an implementation of the Newmark integration algorithm in MATLAB, as a part of an assignment in the course Structural Dynamics at TUM.
The delievered report is also added for further information. Some of the code is written by Prof. Daniel J. Rixen. This is closer explained in the header of main_SD_assignment.m

An exam preparation compendium is also added that was written by me from the lecture notes, made for personal use. Hopefully it could be of use for other students as well. It is very unpolished, and probably contains some errors, so use with care ;)
